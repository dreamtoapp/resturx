N+1 Query Audit Report

Scope: Full repository scan for potential N+1 patterns (database calls inside loops or per-item fetches).

Summary
- No critical N+1 issues detected in primary data paths.
- Most queries use includes, parallel fetches, or single bulk queries followed by in-memory mapping.
- A few areas could be further optimized if data volumes grow, but are not N+1.

Checked Hotspots (safe)
- Products list filtering
  - File: `app/dashboard/management-products/actions/fetchFilteredProducts.ts`
  - Pattern: bulk fetch products + suppliers, map with `supplierMap` (no per-item DB).
- Inventory report
  - File: `app/dashboard/management-reports/inventory/actions/getInventory.ts`
  - Pattern: bulk fetch products + suppliers, map with `supplierMap` (no per-item DB).
- Orders listing
  - File: `app/dashboard/management-orders/actions/getAllOrders.ts`
  - Pattern: single `findMany` with deep `include`, paginated.
- Category page data
  - File: `app/(e-comm)/(home-page-sections)/categories/action/actions.ts`
  - Pattern: category list once; product list and count in a single `$transaction`.
- Customer detail
  - File: `app/dashboard/management-users/customer/actions/getCustomerById.ts`
  - Pattern: single query with nested `include`; in-memory transforms only.
- Products SEO matrix
  - File: `app/dashboard/management-seo/product/actions/get-all-products-seo.ts`
  - Pattern: products once, SEO once (filtered by ids/locales), then in-memory join.

Potential Watchpoints (not N+1 now)
- Sales report aggregation
  - File: `app/dashboard/management-reports/sales/action/getSalesReportData.ts`
  - Uses a single `orderItem.findMany({ include: { product: true } })`, then groups in memory. Consider Prisma `groupBy` for very large datasets, but no N+1.
- Any new per-item enrichment logic
  - Avoid patterns like `products.map(async p => db.*)`.

Heuristics Used
- Grepped for `map(async`, `forEach(`, `for (...)` with `db.` calls.
- Reviewed key server actions and pages performing list+detail rendering.

Recommendations
- Keep using bulk queries + includes/maps; avoid per-item DB calls inside loops.
- For large analytics, prefer Prisma `groupBy` or SQL aggregation instead of full in-memory grouping.
- Re-run this audit after significant feature additions.

No changes required
- No code edits needed for N+1 at this time.
