# Address Management Components

This folder contains the organized components for the address management system.

## Component Structure

### Core Components
- **AddressManagement.tsx** - Main container component that orchestrates all functionality
- **AddressForm.tsx** - Form component for adding/editing addresses (existing)

### New Organized Components
- **AddressHeader.tsx** - Header section with title, description, and action buttons
- **EmptyAddressState.tsx** - Empty state display when no addresses exist
- **AddressCard.tsx** - Individual address card with actions and information
- **AddressList.tsx** - Container for rendering the list of address cards
- **AddressFormDialog.tsx** - Dialog wrapper for the address form

### Shared Types
- **types.ts** - Centralized type definitions for Address interface

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each component has one clear purpose
2. **Reusability** - Components can be easily reused in other parts of the app
3. **Maintainability** - Easier to debug and modify specific functionality
4. **Testing** - Smaller components are easier to unit test
5. **Code Splitting** - Better tree-shaking and performance optimization

## Props Interface

All components use the centralized `Address` interface from `types.ts` to ensure consistency and type safety across the component tree.
