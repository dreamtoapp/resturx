# Helpers Folder

This folder contains utility functions, hooks, and helper logic for the address management system.

## What Goes Here

- **Utility functions** for address formatting, validation, and data transformation
- **Custom hooks** for address-related state management and API calls
- **Helper constants** and enums specific to address functionality
- **Data transformation** functions for converting between different address formats
- **Validation helpers** beyond the basic Zod schema validation

## Examples

- `addressFormatters.ts` - Format addresses for display
- `addressValidators.ts` - Additional validation logic
- `useAddressState.ts` - Custom hook for address state management
- `addressConstants.ts` - Address-related constants and enums

## Organization

Keep functions focused and single-purpose. Each file should handle one specific aspect of address management functionality.
