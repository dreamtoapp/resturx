This folder holds UI components that are specific to the `app/dashboard/management/health-status` route.

Guidelines:
- Keep components small and focused on this route.
- Share-only-if-generic: if a component becomes generic, promote it to `components/`.
- Do not introduce global styles; rely on existing Tailwind tokens.
