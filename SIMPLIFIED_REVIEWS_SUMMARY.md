  isReported   Boolean  @default(false)
  reportReason String?
  moderatedBy  String?  @db.ObjectId    // Admin who moderated
  moderatedAt  DateTime?
  
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())

  @@unique([customerId, restaurantId]) // ⭐ One review per user per restaurant
  @@index([restaurantId])
  @@map("restaurantreviews")
}
```

## 🎯 Current Flow

### **Customer Side:**

```
1. Customer logs in
2. Visits restaurant page
3. Clicks "Write Review"
4. Sees eligibility check:
   ✅ Already reviewed? → Can't review again
   ✅ Not reviewed yet? → Can write review
5. Writes review (rating + comment)
6. Submits → ✅ Published IMMEDIATELY!
7. Review visible to everyone instantly
```

**No verification, no waiting, no approval needed!**

---

### **Restaurant Owner Side:**

```
Restaurant Portal → Reviews Section

Dashboard shows:
- 📊 All Reviews count
- ⭐ Average Rating
- 💬 Responded count
- 🚨 Reported count

For each review:
- ✅ View full review
- ✅ Respond to review
- ❌ Can NOT approve/reject
- ❌ Can NOT delete

Owner builds trust by responding professionally!
```

### **Super Admin Side (Future):**

```
Admin Dashboard (to be built):
- View all reviews across platform
- Moderate/delete spam
- Handle reported reviews
- Ban abusive users
- Platform-level control
```

## 🔒 Anti-Spam Features

1. ✅ **Must be logged in** to write review
2. ✅ **One review per user per restaurant** (database constraint)
3. ✅ **Email verification** (if you have it in auth)
4. ✅ **Users can report reviews** (isReported field)
